# October 2022 - Open Data Science Hackathon

The Open Data Science Hackathon is an open data science hackathon to support public goods, led by GitcoinDAO’s FDD workstream.

The hackathon aims to nurture an open data science community to play a crucial role in defending and growing web3 and open approaches to innovation.

Data scientists and analysts will be able to win prizes by contributing useful models and insights. Any organization or individual interested in protecting communities from malicious actors and in funding public goods through funding rounds will find something valuable in these hackathons and the broader open data science community. 

The Open Data Science Hackathon ran from 10/3 - 10/31. Prizes total $18,250, and will be split among the top finishers in three categories: Sybil Slayers, Human Hackers, and Dune Detectives!
